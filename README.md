## Purpose
I built this app to help me record my assignments easier. After setting up the classes I have and the common assignments in each class, I could quickly record the type and due date of the assignments for the class. This is helpful during school, because it allows me to easily record information as the instructor is talking.
## How to use
### Setting Classes
To record all of your classes on the app, go to the settings page and click add class and type in the name of the class. You can remove a class by clicking on the class, you want removed and clicking the remove app button.
### Setting Options
To set an assignment under a class, click on the class to highlight it. Then click the add option button and type in the option you want to add. To remove the option, just click on the option and click remove option.
### Adding Assignments/Reminders
To add an assignment, click the plus button in the upper right corner to reach the New Assignment page. Under the New Assignment page, select the class the assignment is for and the option correlated with the assignment for that class (this is optional). Then to set the due date of the assignment, you could either type in the date of the week the assignment is due or input the date. Finally click the star on the bottom right corner to add the assignment. To add a reminder, just click the switch button on the upper left corner and follow the same procedure. Unlike assignments, reminders will be automatically deleted once the due date is up.
### Displaying Assignments
To view your current assignments, click the file button on the top right side of your screen, this will bring you to the todo page. Under the todo page, you can see your current assignments and reminders. Assignments that are about to be due will be orange and assignments that are past due will be red. To remove an assignment, click the checkbox next to it.
